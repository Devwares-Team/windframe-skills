# Windframe HTTP API Anti-Patterns

Use this checklist to avoid behavior that violates the Windframe API workflow.

---

## Choosing Style Or Color For The User

Bad:

```json
{
  "uiStyle": "[hard-coded style]",
  "primaryColor": "[hard-coded color]"
}
```

when the user did not choose those values.

Fix:

1. Call `GET /ui-styles`.
2. Present the available styles and practical color options.
3. Recommend suitable pairings.
4. Ask the user to choose `uiStyle` and `primaryColor`.
5. Call `POST /design-context` with the selected values.

---

## Skipping The UI Styles Fetch

Bad:

```text
Use a fixed style for a fixed UI category without checking the live API.
```

Fix:

Treat `GET /ui-styles` as authoritative. Local docs can guide recommendations, but the API output controls what can be offered.

---

## Treating Style Context As Finished Code

Bad:

```text
Here is your result: { "context": { ... } }
```

Fix:

Use the returned `context` and optional `fonts` to generate or convert UI code in the user's project framework.

---

## Using The Wrong Parameter Name

Bad:

```json
{
  "theme": "[selected color]"
}
```

with `POST /design-context`.

Fix:

Use `primaryColor`:

```json
{
  "primaryColor": "[user-selected color, current, or custom hex]"
}
```

---

## Vague Prompts

Bad:

```text
A landing page for a startup.
```

Fix:

Include product, audience, goal, sections, copy direction, CTAs, content counts, interactions, and constraints:

```text
A landing page for a B2B contract management SaaS targeting legal teams. Hero headline: "Sign faster, dispute less". Sections: hero with demo CTA, 4 feature cards, security proof, 2 testimonials, 3-tier pricing, FAQ, footer.
```

---

## Overloading A Conversion

Bad:

```text
Convert this dashboard to a specific style, rewrite the product positioning, add pricing, change the nav, and create a mobile app screen.
```

Fix:

Separate content changes from style conversion. First clarify or update the UI structure, then call `POST /design-context` for the selected target style and color.

---

## Ignoring Plan Or Credit Errors

If the API returns `pro_plan_required`, tell the user the feature requires Windframe Pro and provide `https://windframe.dev/pricing`.

Do not keep retrying the same call without resolving the account state.

---

## Leaving Placeholder Content

Avoid final UI with:

- `Lorem ipsum`
- `[Insert text here]`
- `{{placeholder}}`
- Generic company names when the user provided a real product name

If the user did not provide copy, write reasonable copy from their brief and state any assumptions.

---

## Framework Mismatch

Do not generate React in a Vue project, Vue in a Svelte project, or static HTML inside an existing component app unless the user requested it.

Check project files before writing:

- `.jsx` or `.tsx`: React
- `.vue`: Vue
- `.svelte`: Svelte
- `app/`, `pages/`, or `next.config.*`: Next.js
- Otherwise, ask or generate framework-neutral HTML only if appropriate

---

## Auth Misuse

Authentication happens through the `Authorization: Bearer` or `x-api-key` header. Never hard-code API keys into project files. Never log or expose keys in output.

Only revisit authentication if the API returns `missing_api_key` or `invalid_api_key`.
